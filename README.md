# Shih_Yu_Lai

üëã Hi, I am Shih-Yu, Lai. I am pursuing my graduate studies at National Taiwan University, actively engaging in multiple research projects in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Computer Graphics**, and **Robotics**. I am a member of [Communications and Multimedia Laboratory](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/new_cml_website/index.php), and [Interactive Graphics Laboratory](http://graphics.im.ntu.edu.tw/index.html), advised by Prof. [Robin Bing-Yu Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8UC5dY4AAAAJ&hl=en). 

From July to August 2025, he participated as an **HPC intern** at the **[RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS)](https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/)**, where, under the guidance of Prof. [Hirozumi Yamaguchi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pUpK9hYAAAAJ&hl=ja) (Osaka University), he worked on the design of large-scale digital twin models, multi-modal fusion sensing using WiFi and point cloud, high-performance computing using the supercomputer "Fugaku," and building a distributed edge/cloud federated learning pipeline for smart cities. From Sept. 2025 to Jun.2026, I would be a VLM Research Intern, joining **[MoonShine Studio](https://moonshine.tw/)**, Taiwan‚Äôs leading creative production studio in animation, VFX, motion design, and entertainment. I collaborated with animators to build visual-language-model-assisted creator support tools that streamline storyboarding and automate post-production. My goal is to support creators in seamlessly integrating the design-to-production workflow throughout the creative process. As an ex-Deep Learning Intern at **[Delta Electronics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/delta-electronics/)**, I built a point-cloud autoencoder and predictive inductance model by integrating finite-element materials analysis with electromagnetic simulation.

With my bachelor‚Äôs degree from National Cheng Kung University, I am precise in data science, tackling complex analysis, and control problems in **Digital Fabrication**, **Computer Vision/Graphics**, **Graph Mining**, **Digital Twins**, **Human-Computer Interaction**, and **Information Systems**. This background drove me to participate in the [Robot-Aided Creation and Construction Research Group](https://rccn.dev/en/projects/) led by Prof. [Yang-Ting Shen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yang-Ting-Shen) and [Chia-Ching Yen](https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/en/persons/chia-ching-yen), centered on the study of computational assemblies in graph reinforcement learning, to design and analyze the fabrication using robotics, computer-aided design, and spatial computation. Meanwhile, I am affiliated with the [Urban Science and Computing Lab](https://hphsieh.github.io/nckuee/research.html) in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering led by Prof. [Hsun-Ping Hsieh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f6SBzrAAAAAJ&hl=en) and developed the digital twin systems with  2D/3D modeling expertise. 

üßë‚Äçüé® My practical experience in computer science, robotics, and various design domains allows me to truly understand the needs of users in the design industry, enabling me to develop highly applicable information systems and tools. These research areas enable me to draw knowledge and techniques from various fields, fostering a holistic and innovative approach to interdisciplinary problem-solving.

üíª I am a Python enthusiast who is also keen to learn other technical skills. I've had the opportunity to serve as a data engineer and HCI designer in various technical roles, which has provided me with a strong familiarity with user services and design tools developing. Aside from that, I also possess moderate data sciences/frontend/CAD skills including tools like C++, Matlab, OpenGL, Unity 3D, ROS/ROS2, Fushion360, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, AutoCAD, Rhinoceros, and such.
